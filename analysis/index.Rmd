## Analyzed Simulated Data
Note that the below analyses are done with CONDITIONING on the covariance matrix $\Sigma$. The reason for this is that we can include a shrinkage term for indirect effects and still have Bayes Factor be analytic with summary data.

## Analyzed Real Data
For now, these data were analyzed unconditional on $\Sigma$, using an improper Wishart prior for $\Sigma$.
